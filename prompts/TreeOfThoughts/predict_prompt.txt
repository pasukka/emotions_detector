Imagine three different experts are discussing which emotion is expressed in the text.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave. The last expert has to say what they all tend to think.
The question is which emotion is expressed in the text:
{text}.
